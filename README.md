# NicePhrases
 A simple platform that shows random nice sentences to make your day better

Tools I used: 
 - PyQt5
 - QtDesigner
 - Mysql.connector
 
 What I learnt:
 
 - I made a simple GUI interface with QtDesigner.
 - I connected all the buttons, labels and text boxes to a database and the interface.
 - I used some SQL querys to communicate with my database through mysql.connector
 - I pratice reading documentation, debugging code and coding.
 
 Some errors in this project I've found, that need maintenence:
 
 - If you delete anything from your database, the random number can take this deleted ID anyway. The program will raise an error.
